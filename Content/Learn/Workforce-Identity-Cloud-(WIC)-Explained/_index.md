**In Phase 1?**: "No, new content can be created at later phase."

**In Phase 2?**: TBD

**Related to help docs?**: Maybe. If a help doc already exists, this doc can be a summary redirect to the main help doc page.



### Content Notes

**New or existing doc?**: New doc - new content

**Target personas**: New IAM Developers,Developers new to Okta

**Description**: Explains WIC and compares it to the CIC domain. Describes the domain of what developer.okta.com covers.

**Validation**: - 26% of respondents could not identify Workforce Identity Cloud despite "Workforce" being in the definition.
- Developers new to IAM and Okta are less satisfied with the docs and visit rarely. This document is aimed at this demographic. We want to help these personas "discover" okta.

**Content type: Conceptual overview**

High-level explanations of the underlying concepts, architecture, or design principles behind the product or service. These overviews provide developers with a broader understanding of how the system works.
