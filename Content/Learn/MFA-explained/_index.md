## MFA explained

**In Phase 1?**: "No, new content can be created at later phase."

**In Phase 2?**: TBD

**Related to help docs?**: Maybe. If a help doc already exists, this doc can be a summary redirect to the main help doc page.



### Content Notes

**New or existing doc?**: New doc - new content

**Target personas**: New IAM Developers,Developers new to Okta

**Description**: Explain the very basic concept of MFA. Also, explain the difference between a Factor and an Authenticator.

**Validation**: '- External Oktane 2023: 20% of respondents placed "Multi-factor Authentication" under "IAM Fundamentals". 
- After discussions with employees (and probably customers as well) there is a misunderstanding of what is a "Factor" and what is an Authenticator". This section could also clear this up as well.

**Content type: Explanation**

This content type is focused on more detailed, topic-specific discussions that clarify how certain features, functionalities, or aspects of the product or service operate. This type of document aims to demystify specific elements of the technology, offering practical insights, step-by-step guidance, or in-depth clarification on particular points of interest to developers. 

Unlike the broad scope of a "Conceptual Overview," an "Explanation" dives deeper into individual topics, providing the necessary details that enable developers to understand and work with the product or service more effectively.
