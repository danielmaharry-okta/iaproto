## Overview of Okta APIs

**In Phase 1?**: "No, new content can be created at later phase."

**In Phase 2?**: TBD

**Related to help docs?**: No, targetted towards developers



### Content Notes

**New or existing doc?**: New doc - new content

**Target personas**: New IAM Developers,Developers new to Okta

**Validation**: - At the Oktane MatchIt game, 35.5% of respondents could not define Okta APIs.
- In the Oktane GroupIt game, the topics placed under the APIs and SDKs group represented were very broad in scope.  This broadness may indicate a lack of clarity of the meaning of API and SDK.

**Content type: Explanation**

This content type is focused on more detailed, topic-specific discussions that clarify how certain features, functionalities, or aspects of the product or service operate. This type of document aims to demystify specific elements of the technology, offering practical insights, step-by-step guidance, or in-depth clarification on particular points of interest to developers. 

Unlike the broad scope of a "Conceptual Overview," an "Explanation" dives deeper into individual topics, providing the necessary details that enable developers to understand and work with the product or service more effectively.
