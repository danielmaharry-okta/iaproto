## Single sign-on (SSO)

**In Phase 1?**: "No, new content can be created at later phase."

**In Phase 2?**: TBD

**Related to help docs?**: Maybe. If a help doc already exists, this doc can be a summary redirect to the main help doc page.



### Content Notes

**New or existing doc?**: New doc - new content

**Target personas**: New IAM Developers,Developers new to Okta

**Description**: Answers "What is SSO?", how it differs from a basic sign in,  and "How Okta supports it"

**Validation**: - Developers with low IAM experience rate the docs low. SSO is a basic term that not be well understood by new developers. Based on group-it results, SSO may be a misunderstood term:
    - 35% of participants in the matchit game did not correctly define SSO.
    - There was no a consistent grouping "Single Sign-on" which may indicate ambiguity over the term's meaning.

**Content type: Conceptual overview**

High-level explanations of the underlying concepts, architecture, or design principles behind the product or service. These overviews provide developers with a broader understanding of how the system works.
