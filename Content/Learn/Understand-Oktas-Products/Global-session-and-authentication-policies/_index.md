**In Phase 2?**: TBD

**Related to help docs?**: Maybe. If a help doc already exists, this doc can be a summary redirect to the main help doc page.

**Content type: Explanation**

This content type is focused on more detailed, topic-specific discussions that clarify how certain features, functionalities, or aspects of the product or service operate. This type of document aims to demystify specific elements of the technology, offering practical insights, step-by-step guidance, or in-depth clarification on particular points of interest to developers. 

Unlike the broad scope of a "Conceptual Overview," an "Explanation" dives deeper into individual topics, providing the necessary details that enable developers to understand and work with the product or service more effectively.
