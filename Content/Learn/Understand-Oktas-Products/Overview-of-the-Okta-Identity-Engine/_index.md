## Overview of the Okta Identity Engine

**In Phase 1?**: "Yes, but for phase 1 keep changes to existing doc as minimal as possible"

**In Phase 2?**: TBD

**Related to help docs?**: No, existing dev doc content targetted toward developers



### Content Notes

**New or existing doc?**: Existing doc: changes needed

**Target personas**: New IAM Developers,Developers new to Okta

**Changes to be made**: '- Article title change
- After reading this doc it is rather outdated. We should update this doc and mention Okta's latest offerings (OIG, PAM, etc)
- Also even calling it Identity Engine seems rather dated. Consider limiting "Identity Engine" and discuss with teammates

**Links to original docs**: - Okta Identity Engine overview: https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/oie-intro/

**Content type: Conceptual overview**

High-level explanations of the underlying concepts, architecture, or design principles behind the product or service. These overviews provide developers with a broader understanding of how the system works.
