**Content type: Dynamic Index**

This document type is designed to automatically generate and display a list of child documents when a particular node in the navigation tree is selected. Key characteristics of this content type are:
- Automated Listing: Automatically generates a list of links to child documents based on the site's structure or predefined criteria.
- Parent-Child Relationship: Acts as a parent node that provides access to related subdocuments (children).
- Navigation Facilitation: Serves as a navigational tool to help users easily find and access related documents.
- Dynamic Updating: Updates the list of child documents automatically as new documents are added, existing ones are modified, or old ones are removed.
- Simplicity and Usability: Typically has minimal content itself, focusing on guiding users to the relevant child documents.
