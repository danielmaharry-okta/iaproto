## Plan your IAM solution

**In Phase 1?**: "Yes, but for phase 1 keep changes to existing doc as minimal as possible"

**In Phase 2?**: TBD

**Related to help docs?**: Maybe. If a help doc already exists, this doc can be a summary redirect to the main help doc page.



### Content Notes

**New or existing doc?**: Existing doc: changes needed

**Target personas**: WIC App Developer,Experienced IAM developer

**Changes to be made**: - Remove IAM overview content and place it the IAM overview doc. Keep this doc focused on planning on a particular IAM solution.
- CIAM content needs to be removed.

**Links to original docs**: '- Identity and Access Management (IAM) overview: https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/iam-overview/

**Content type: Explanation**

This content type is focused on more detailed, topic-specific discussions that clarify how certain features, functionalities, or aspects of the product or service operate. This type of document aims to demystify specific elements of the technology, offering practical insights, step-by-step guidance, or in-depth clarification on particular points of interest to developers. 

Unlike the broad scope of a "Conceptual Overview," an "Explanation" dives deeper into individual topics, providing the necessary details that enable developers to understand and work with the product or service more effectively.
