## Add an enterprise IdP

**In Phase 1?**: "Yes, but for phase 1 keep changes to existing doc as minimal as possible"

**In Phase 2?**: TBD

**Related to help docs?**: No, targetted towards developers


### Group Notes

**Group description**: What is an "Enterprise" IdP. We need to define it and understand whether this is the best way to split up IdPs.


### Content Notes

**New or existing doc?**: Existing doc: changes needed

**Target personas**: WIC App Developer,Experienced IAM developer

**Dimensioned by**: Identity provider type

**Changes to be made**: - To make it more clear, change the dimensions to:
    - Azure AD to Azure AD IdP
    - Okta - to Okta -> Okta IdP
    - Generic OIDC IdP
    - Generic SAML 2.0 IdP
- To be consistent, Generic SAML 2.0 IdP should be pulled out into a separate guide. This keeps SAML content surfaced and separate from the other IdPs.
- "What is an ""Enterprise"" IdP. We need to define it and understand whether this is the best way to split up IdPs."
