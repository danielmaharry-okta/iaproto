## Add a sign-in solution to an input constrained device (e.g. Apple TV)

**In Phase 1?**: "Yes, but for phase 1 keep changes to existing doc as minimal as possible"

**In Phase 2?**: TBD

**Related to help docs?**: No, targetted towards developers



### Content Notes

**New or existing doc?**: Existing doc: changes needed

**Target personas**: WIC App Developer,Experienced IAM developer

**Changes to be made**: - This guide contains reference endpoint information that needs to be stripped out of this guide and placed under the API reference if it doesn't exist.
- Understand which auth solution this is for: redirect, embedded, SDKS, API, or a combination of all three. After we find out reorganize in IA appropriately

**Links to original docs**: - Configure Device Authorization Grant Flow: https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/device-authorization-grant/main/

**Content type: Integration guide**

Goal-oriented. Similar to a how-to but the focus is more technical and geared towards developers integrating an SDK, API, or another library into their applications. 
These guides follow a specific use case.  
These guides DO NOT contain API Reference information like parameter descriptions (for example see https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/device-authorization-grant/main/)
