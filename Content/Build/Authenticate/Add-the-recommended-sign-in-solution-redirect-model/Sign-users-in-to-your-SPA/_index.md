Combine this doc with following doc unless there is a strong reason to split out Auth JS
- This doc will need to be refactored in one of the phases. It's covering a lot of uses cases and somewhat hard to follow.

**Links to original docs**: - Sign users in to your SPA using the redirect model: https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa-redirect/angular/main/
- Sign users in to your SPA using the redirect model and Auth JS: https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/auth-js-redirect/main/

**Content type: Integration guide**

Goal-oriented. Similar to a how-to but the focus is more technical and geared towards developers integrating an SDK, API, or another library into their applications. 
These guides follow a specific use case.  
These guides DO NOT contain API Reference information like parameter descriptions (for example see https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/device-authorization-grant/main/)
