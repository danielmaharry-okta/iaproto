## Add the recommended sign-in solution: redirect model

**In Phase 1?**: "Yes, content defined as a dynamic index"

**In Phase 2?**: TBD

**Related to help docs?**: No, it's "glue" documentation not related to the product help docs



### Content Notes

**New or existing doc?**: New doc - new content

**Target personas**: WIC App Developer,Experienced IAM developer

**Changes to be made**: In phase 1 if "Setting up okta org policies" can be unified into one place for all (redirect and embedded) guides, we'll have to add a specific set up guides for redirect and each of the embedded models.

**Validation**: Based on GroupIt Oktane user research, customers seem confused of what Redirect model means. As a result the title includes the task being accomplished.

**Content type: Dynamic Index**

This document type is designed to automatically generate and display a list of child documents when a particular node in the navigation tree is selected. Key characteristics of this content type are:
- Automated Listing: Automatically generates a list of links to child documents based on the site's structure or predefined criteria.
- Parent-Child Relationship: Acts as a parent node that provides access to related subdocuments (children).
- Navigation Facilitation: Serves as a navigational tool to help users easily find and access related documents.
- Dynamic Updating: Updates the list of child documents automatically as new documents are added, existing ones are modified, or old ones are removed.
- Simplicity and Usability: Typically has minimal content itself, focusing on guiding users to the relevant child documents.
