**Changes to be made**: - Update title
- Technically, this sign out could go under the Logout group but the desire was to keep as much as possible all the SDKs docs in one space.

**Links to original docs**: '- User sign out (local app): https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-basic-sign-out/android/main/

**Content type: Integration guide**

Goal-oriented. Similar to a how-to but the focus is more technical and geared towards developers integrating an SDK, API, or another library into their applications. 
These guides follow a specific use case.  
These guides DO NOT contain API Reference information like parameter descriptions (for example see https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/device-authorization-grant/main/)
