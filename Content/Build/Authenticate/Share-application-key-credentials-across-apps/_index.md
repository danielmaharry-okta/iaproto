## Share application key credentials across apps

**In Phase 1?**: "Yes, but for phase 1 keep changes to existing doc as minimal as possible"

**In Phase 2?**: TBD

**Related to help docs?**: No, targetted towards developers



### Content Notes

**New or existing doc?**: Existing doc: changes needed

**Target personas**: WIC App Developer,Experienced IAM developer

**Changes to be made**: - Update title
- Need to understand whether i can use this implementation for redirect, embedded, direct auth, etc. 
    - After we find out, we'll update the keywords accordingly and potentially update the guide placement.

**Links to original docs**: - Share application key credentials for IdPs across Apps: https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sharing-cert/main/

**Content type: Integration guide**

Goal-oriented. Similar to a how-to but the focus is more technical and geared towards developers integrating an SDK, API, or another library into their applications. 
These guides follow a specific use case.  
These guides DO NOT contain API Reference information like parameter descriptions (for example see https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/device-authorization-grant/main/)
