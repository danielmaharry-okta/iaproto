## Add a browser sign-in solution for mobile devices

**In Phase 1?**: "Yes, but for phase 1 keep changes to existing doc as minimal as possible"

**In Phase 2?**: TBD

**Related to help docs?**: No, targetted towards developers



### Content Notes

**New or existing doc?**: Existing doc: changes needed

**Target personas**: WIC App Developer,Experienced IAM developer

**Changes to be made**: - Add a intro paragraph specifically stating what scenarios this implementation is used for. When would i use this scenario over direct auth?
- We need to make it clear that this is a Non-interaction code implementation
- Remove "Native" and use Mobile instead. "Native" is unclear and not inclusive.
- Remove SSO from title to make it less confusing since it's talking about Authenticating

Note: Possibly @Maurice Sharp could take ownership of this "mobile" guide

**Links to original docs**: - Configure SSO for Native apps: https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/configure-native-sso/main/

**Content type: Integration guide**

Goal-oriented. Similar to a how-to but the focus is more technical and geared towards developers integrating an SDK, API, or another library into their applications. 
These guides follow a specific use case.  
These guides DO NOT contain API Reference information like parameter descriptions (for example see https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/device-authorization-grant/main/)
