## Add a third-party risk provider

**In Phase 1?**: "Yes, it's existing content requiring little to no change"

**In Phase 2?**: TBD

**Related to help docs?**: No, targetted towards developers



### Content Notes

**New or existing doc?**: Existing doc: changes needed

**Target personas**: WIC App Developer,Experienced IAM developer

**Description**: This document shows how to configure a third party provider using the API and create a simple event log. I think we could make this use case more robust and describe a better more detailed use case.

This risk engine described in this doc  can be useful in both secure and system log. A link will be in the report and monitor section as well.

**Changes to be made**: - Update title

**Links to original docs**: - Third-party risk provider integration: https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/third-party-risk-integration/main/

**Content type: Integration guide**

Goal-oriented. Similar to a how-to but the focus is more technical and geared towards developers integrating an SDK, API, or another library into their applications. 
These guides follow a specific use case.  
These guides DO NOT contain API Reference information like parameter descriptions (for example see https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/device-authorization-grant/main/)
