**Related to help docs?**: No, targetted towards developers



### Content Notes

**New or existing doc?**: New doc - new content

**Target personas**: WIC App Developer,Experienced IAM developer

**Changes to be made**: Notes from conversation with Bhavik, Maurice and Dan: 
- Doing a youtube about potential use cases. They have identified 525 custs using unofficial powershell cli. They are the target market. 
- Target them in pendo in admin console - target them and notify them, Tell them Okta as a new powershell cli, Link to youtube podcast.  That is the plan. 
- Along with the youtube podcast, we can guide them to docs, if there are no docs, we might need to include github repo link. Ideally, we have docs.
- Most of the readmes are not that good. You won't be any worse off if using readmes. 

Scheduled another meeting on March 28th, 2024

**Validation**: This guide is driven by business objectives. There were earlier discussions regarding a Powershell CLI guide. We need to work with Bhavik Thakkar and Jeff Taylor for guidance on this doc.

**Content type: How-to: developer focused**
