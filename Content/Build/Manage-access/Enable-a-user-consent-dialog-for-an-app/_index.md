## Enable a user consent dialog for an app

**In Phase 1?**: "Yes, but for phase 1 keep changes to existing doc as minimal as possible"

**In Phase 2?**: TBD

**Related to help docs?**: No, targetted towards developers


### Group Notes

**Group description**: This article discusses how to enable a consent dialog for an app wanting permission to access certain resources


### Content Notes

**New or existing doc?**: Existing doc: changes needed

**Target personas**: WIC App Developer,Experienced IAM developer

**Changes to be made**: - This guide needs to main things:
    - Content answer "When would I use this user consent functionality over other methods?" At a high level it seems clunky to use this method to manage access vs other role based approaches.
    - Is this method still relevant with FGA now  available? 
    - A flowchart is needed describing the flow.

**Links to original docs**: - Request user consent: https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/request-user-consent/main/

**Content type: How-to: developer focused**

Goal-oriented. Focused on developing a solution for a specific use case. Developer focused. Cites code samples.
