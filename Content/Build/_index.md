### Group Notes

**Group description**: This group is oriented toward developers looking for ways to integrate Okta with their applications. The types of docs focus specifically on: 

- Specific use cases
- Best practices

The largest topics are:

- LCM
- OIG
- Authenntication
- Automation

### Content Notes

**New or existing doc?**: New doc - new content

**Target personas**: WIC App Developer,Experienced IAM developer

**Description**: Sets up journeys and provides links to content under this node. See Guide Hub description for more details on the contents of this doc type.
The journey from simplest to most complex is:

1. Run a sign-in sample app
2. Integrate a sign-in with a quickstart
3. Integrate a sign-in redirect (simplest)
4. Integrate a sign-in embedded widget 
5. Integrate a sign-in with embedded SDK
6. Integrate a sign-in with Direct Auth
7. Integrate other solutions including updating users, syncing users across systems, and more

**Validation**: Why build?

- The dev docs IA is focus on Action and Task oriented words.
- Most or all developers are building (or will in the future)  a solution with Okta

Why the type of docs:
- Respondents are looking for:
    - more use cases
    - simplify the content
    - best practices (OIN)

Why the topics chosen:
- User research indicates the top solutions customers are building are:
    - Authentication
    - LCM
- Automation

**Content type: Guide Hub**

This type of document serves as a central navigational starting point within a larger documentation system. It's structured to outline various user journeys, guiding users to specific documents through organized links, often presented in a tree view or a similar hierarchical structure. Some key characteristics of a Guide Hub or Documentation Hub:

1. Central Starting Point: Serves as the main entry point for users exploring the documentation.
2. User Journey Orientations: Lays out different paths users can take, depending on their goals or interests.
3. Hierarchical Navigation: Presents a tree-view or a similar structure to show the relationship between different documents.
4. Linking to Child Documents: Includes links to more specific, detailed documents (child docs) under each section of the user journey.
5. Overview and Context: Provides a brief overview of each section or user journey, giving context before users dive into detailed documents.
6. Flexibility for Exploration: Allows users to easily navigate between different parts of the documentation without losing their way.

A Guide Hub is especially useful in large documentation systems where the sheer volume of information can be overwhelming. It helps in organizing the content in a user-friendly manner, making it easier for users to find what they need without feeling lost.
