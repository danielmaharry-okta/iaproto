## Migrate users with password hooks

**In Phase 1?**: "Yes, it's existing content requiring little to no change"

**In Phase 2?**: TBD

**Related to help docs?**: No, targetted towards developers



### Content Notes

**New or existing doc?**: Existing doc: changes needed

**Target personas**: WIC App Developer,Experienced IAM developer

**Changes to be made**: Update title

Changes beyond phase 1:
Per @Brian Duffield, the Password Hook content is similar to the Password Import inline hook. I think there are valid reasons to keep this doc in this section with more of a focus on migration. Maybe add links to the existing Password Import inline hook guide.

**Links to original docs**: - Import Users with Inline Password Hooks: https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/migrate-to-okta-password-hooks/main/

**Content type: How-to: developer focused**

Goal-oriented. Focused on developing a solution for a specific use case. Developer focused. Cites code samples.
