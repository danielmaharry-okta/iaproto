## Test simplest sign-in integration with a redirect sample app

**In Phase 1?**: "Yes, but for phase 1 keep changes to existing doc as minimal as possible"

**In Phase 2?**: TBD

**Related to help docs?**: No, targetted towards developers


### Group Notes

**Group description**: This doc discusses how to get the sample apps up and running with the redirect solution. I was debating on putting in the Authentication section but felt it made more sense in a IAM or Okta Product Dev Newbie user flow


### Content Notes

**New or existing doc?**: Existing doc: changes needed

**Target personas**: WIC App Developer,Experienced IAM developer

**Dimensioned by**: Language

**Changes to be made**: Need to investigate how much of the configuration can we place in [ID: 236](/Build/Get-started/Get-an-Okta-account-and-set-up-your-org/_index.md).

**Links to original docs**: - Use redirect auth with the Identity Engine sample apps: https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sampleapp-oie-redirectauth/android/main/

**Content type: How-to: developer focused**

Goal-oriented. Focused on developing a solution for a specific use case. Developer focused. Cites code samples.
