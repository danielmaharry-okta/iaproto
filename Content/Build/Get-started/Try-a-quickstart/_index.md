## Try a quickstart

**In Phase 1?**: "No, I propose to postpone this section for a future phase."

**In Phase 2?**: TBD

**Related to help docs?**: No, it's "glue" documentation not related to the product help docs


### Group Notes

**Group description**: The quick start proposal is defined here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P8Jt4kvVCC9zAeDsgd18RYXymuNqnHjJLvcy2VtLuis/edit#heading=h.7xq7dm2x4vk6

PUSH TO PHASE 2 PROPOSAL
I'm proposing to push the "Quickstarts" into Phase 2. My reasoning is for the following reasons:

- Quickstarts were heavily discussed when Okta was moving to CIC. But now that we are in WIC, I don't think they make as much sense, considering the workforce focus. We can confirm this at Oktane, however.
- We don't have the resources to create and maintain a set of quick-start guides and full integration guides that describe integrating redirect, embedded, etc.
- A lot of the content in the "DevDocs Quickstart Report" guide would fit better in other places in the IA, including IAM fundamentals, WIC vs CIS vs CIC, etc" 
- I'm questioning how "quick" can we a quickstart guide. The current "quickstart" guides we currently have on the site, are by no means "quick" relative to Auth0's quick start guides.  We don't currently have the infrastructure in place to develop a quickstart like Auth0's with the interface directly in the browser.

After we publish phase 1 and the new IA is in place we can better gauge whether quickstart's make sense.

### Content Notes

**New or existing doc?**: IA defined in a separate document

**Target personas**: WIC App Developer,Experienced IAM developer

**Content type: Guide Hub**

This type of document serves as a central navigational starting point within a larger documentation system. It's structured to outline various user journeys, guiding users to specific documents through organized links, often presented in a tree view or a similar hierarchical structure. Some key characteristics of a Guide Hub or Documentation Hub:

1. Central Starting Point: Serves as the main entry point for users exploring the documentation.
2. User Journey Orientations: Lays out different paths users can take, depending on their goals or interests.
3. Hierarchical Navigation: Presents a tree-view or a similar structure to show the relationship between different documents.
4. Linking to Child Documents: Includes links to more specific, detailed documents (child docs) under each section of the user journey.
5. Overview and Context: Provides a brief overview of each section or user journey, giving context before users dive into detailed documents.
6. Flexibility for Exploration: Allows users to easily navigate between different parts of the documentation without losing their way.

A Guide Hub is especially useful in large documentation systems where the sheer volume of information can be overwhelming. It helps in organizing the content in a user-friendly manner, making it easier for users to find what they need without feeling lost.
