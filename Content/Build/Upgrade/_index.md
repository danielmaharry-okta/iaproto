## Upgrade

**In Phase 1?**: "Yes, content defined as a dynamic index"

**In Phase 2?**: TBD

**Related to help docs?**: No, it's "glue" documentation not related to the product help docs



### Content Notes

**New or existing doc?**: New doc - new content

**Target personas**: WIC App Developer,Experienced IAM developer

**Changes to be made**: Changes have been made to this section but they are minimized for now because: 

- Lack of user research on specifically how customers are working with the current upgrade docs
- The docs are already isolated into one section on the site and seem fairly organized, although, they would need to be analyzed from a user journey perspective in the future
- An educated guess would be that Upgrade docs are not used as much by customers when compared to other docs such as Authentication (We need  to confirm this)

**Links to original docs**: If a dynamic index can be customized, add a link to a doc to this [ID: 310](/Build/Manage-user-sessions/Manage-your-user-sessions/_index.md)

**Content type: Dynamic Index**

This document type is designed to automatically generate and display a list of child documents when a particular node in the navigation tree is selected. Key characteristics of this content type are:
- Automated Listing: Automatically generates a list of links to child documents based on the site's structure or predefined criteria.
- Parent-Child Relationship: Acts as a parent node that provides access to related subdocuments (children).
- Navigation Facilitation: Serves as a navigational tool to help users easily find and access related documents.
- Dynamic Updating: Updates the list of child documents automatically as new documents are added, existing ones are modified, or old ones are removed.
- Simplicity and Usability: Typically has minimal content itself, focusing on guiding users to the relevant child documents.
