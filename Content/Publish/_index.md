## Publish

**In Phase 1?**: "Yes, but for phase 1 keep changes to existing doc as minimal as possible"

**In Phase 2?**: TBD

**Related to help docs?**: No, it's "glue" documentation not related to the product help docs


### Group Notes

**Group description**: - Reasons for the name publish:
    - Aligned with the action/task based focus of the site
    - The ultimate goal of this section is to "Publish" on the OIN
    - Some user research evidence
- Existing doc needs to be updated to reflect new changes to sub groups
- 

### Content Notes

**New or existing doc?**: Existing doc: changes needed

**Target personas**: WIC App Developer,Experienced IAM developer

**Changes to be made**: - There was a discussion last year to update this doc since:
    - There was dissatisfaction from team members over the HTML format, and it's overall content
- SInce "SAML and OIDC" are not in the IA and are instead dimensions into the SSO docs, surface the specific links to SAML and OIDC in this guide.

**Links to original docs**: - Publish your integration to the fastest-growing cloud security ecosystem: https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/okta-integration-network/

**Validation**: Why "Publish" was chosen from a user research perspective:
- 4 of the top 10 misunderstood terms are OIN. These include:
    - SCIM Integration
    - OIN Integration
    - OIN Manager
    - Single Sign On Integration
- As a result, the use of "Integration" or "OIN" may confuse readers

**Content type: Guide Hub**

This type of document serves as a central navigational starting point within a larger documentation system. It's structured to outline various user journeys, guiding users to specific documents through organized links, often presented in a tree view or a similar hierarchical structure. Some key characteristics of a Guide Hub or Documentation Hub:

1. Central Starting Point: Serves as the main entry point for users exploring the documentation.
2. User Journey Orientations: Lays out different paths users can take, depending on their goals or interests.
3. Hierarchical Navigation: Presents a tree-view or a similar structure to show the relationship between different documents.
4. Linking to Child Documents: Includes links to more specific, detailed documents (child docs) under each section of the user journey.
5. Overview and Context: Provides a brief overview of each section or user journey, giving context before users dive into detailed documents.
6. Flexibility for Exploration: Allows users to easily navigate between different parts of the documentation without losing their way.

A Guide Hub is especially useful in large documentation systems where the sheer volume of information can be overwhelming. It helps in organizing the content in a user-friendly manner, making it easier for users to find what they need without feeling lost.
