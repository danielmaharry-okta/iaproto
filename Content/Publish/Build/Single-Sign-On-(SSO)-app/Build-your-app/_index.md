## Build your SSO app

**In Phase 1?**: "Yes, since it's a new doc pulling from existing content"

**In Phase 2?**: TBD

**Related to help docs?**: No, targetted towards developers


### Group Notes

**Group description**: Provides links to places that discusses how to build an SSO

### Content Notes

**New or existing doc?**: New doc with new content but also pulling from existing content

**Target personas**: WIC App Developer,Experienced IAM developer

**Description**: Add SWA dimension

**Changes to be made**: - See existing content field for more details.
- Add SWA dimension

**Links to original docs**: Only include content and links to other docs that show how to build an SSO app. This doc can be the basis of it:

- Build a Single Sign-On (SSO) integration: https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/build-sso-integration/openidconnect/main/

**Validation**: - It provides links to other docs on how to build an SSO app. Does not include content on how to build an SSO App.
- We don't want directions on how to build an SSO app here because:
    - We would duplicate so much content already available in other guides
    - It creates a misconception that SSO Apps are created within the domain of OIN, which is not accurate
    - Creates confusion of what changes are for OIN and what are not
