Google analytics from Jan 2022 to Jan 2024. Release notes has been brought down a level because:

- release notes landing page represent .03% of all pageviews. For context: 
    - Reference landing page represents .31% of all pageviews
    - Guides landing page represents .24% of all pageviews
    - Concepts represent .04% of all pageviews
- 64% of release note entrances come from google, bing or another external source
- 36% release note entrances come from the site itself
    - Of the 36% coming from the site itself - 24% come from Event types because of all the embedded links

**Content type: Explanation**

This content type is focused on more detailed, topic-specific discussions that clarify how certain features, functionalities, or aspects of the product or service operate. This type of document aims to demystify specific elements of the technology, offering practical insights, step-by-step guidance, or in-depth clarification on particular points of interest to developers. 

Unlike the broad scope of a "Conceptual Overview," an "Explanation" dives deeper into individual topics, providing the necessary details that enable developers to understand and work with the product or service more effectively.
