Welcome to our Developer Documentation Information Architecture (IA) Prototype! We're on a mission to elevate your experience by unveiling a redesigned structure that makes finding and utilizing our resources more intuitive.

This prototype website serves as a visual guide to our proposed new IA groupings, showcasing how documents are categorized and how you can navigate through them. As you explore, you'll encounter placeholders for both existing and newly proposed documentation, complete with details on content type, document titles, user research validation, and more. While the actual documents are not hosted here, links to the existing content on our current developer site are provided for your reference.

Here's what we need from you:
* Dive into the navigation menu to explore the proposed groupings and item placements.
* Reflect on the clarity and intuitiveness of these new groupings and the ease of navigation. Consider how the new structure aligns with your expectations and needs.
* Share your invaluable feedback using the [IA Prototype feedback spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wsnbNcJdPsxHszTYzDEPYj4ZUEyJs_YGtRgUdsSruZU/edit#gid=0). Your insights on the new IA, document placements, and any additional attributes are crucial for refining our documentation site.

Your feedback is pivotal in crafting a documentation site that is informative, easily navigable, and intuitive. We thank you in advance for your time and thoughtful contributions.
