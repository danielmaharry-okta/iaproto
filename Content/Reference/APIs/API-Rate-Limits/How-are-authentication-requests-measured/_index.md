## How are authentication requests measured?

**In Phase 2?**: TBD


### Group Notes

**Group description**: Discursive document covering how unauthenticated requests to Okta's OIDC \authorize and other anonymous-possible endpoints are counted and measured against existing rate limits. These are known as "Client-based rate limits".  Marked as no changes needed, but intro needs some work so it's easier to understand the problem that client-based rate limits are trying to solve.

### Content Notes

**New or existing doc?**: New doc - new content

**Target personas**: WIC App Developer,Experienced IAM developer

**Links to original docs**: - Client-based rate limits: https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/rl-clientbased/

**Content type: Explanation**

This content type is focused on more detailed, topic-specific discussions that clarify how certain features, functionalities, or aspects of the product or service operate. This type of document aims to demystify specific elements of the technology, offering practical insights, step-by-step guidance, or in-depth clarification on particular points of interest to developers. 

Unlike the broad scope of a "Conceptual Overview," an "Explanation" dives deeper into individual topics, providing the necessary details that enable developers to understand and work with the product or service more effectively.
