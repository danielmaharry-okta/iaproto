## Okta expression language

**In Phase 1?**: "Yes, since it's a new doc pulling from existing content"

**In Phase 2?**: TBD

**Related to help docs?**: No, targetted towards developers


### Group Notes

**Group description**: At the moment, there are two documents. The main one covers the "legacy" Okta expression language and the secondary one covers it in Identity Engine. Suggest that these documents are role-reversed so that the main doc covers all the support for IDX and the secondary doc covers the diffs between it and Classic Engine.

### Content Notes

**New or existing doc?**: New doc with new content but also pulling from existing content

**Target personas**: WIC App Developer,Experienced IAM developer
