    <description>Okta Inline Hooks Click here to give feedback about this page&#xA;Content Notes Target personas: WIC App Developer,Experienced IAM developer&#xA;Description: Will be hosted in Redocly. This is the overview of the section containing sample JSON content to and from each type of inline hook.&#xA;Changes to be made: This document is currently dynamically generated, but it should be a written piece fo content that pulls in all the common introduction text from the reference documents underneath it, so those docs can just be reference material rather than having to be an introduction to hooks and then a specific type of hook first.</description>
