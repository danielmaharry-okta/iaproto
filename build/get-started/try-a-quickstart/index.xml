    <description>Try a quickstart Click here to give feedback about this page&#xA;About This Page Is this a new page?: IA defined in a separate document&#xA;Target personas: WIC App Developer, Experienced IAM developer&#xA;Description: A number of quickstart guides have been proposed here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P8Jt4kvVCC9zAeDsgd18RYXymuNqnHjJLvcy2VtLuis/edit#heading=h.7xq7dm2x4vk6&#xA;However, it is still up for debate whether we will include them in due course.&#xA;Quickstarts were heavily discussed when Okta was moving to CIC. But now that we are in WIC, I don’t think they make as much sense, considering the workforce focus.</description>
