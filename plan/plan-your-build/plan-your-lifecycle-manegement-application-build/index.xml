    <description>Plan your lifecycle management application build Click here to give feedback about this page&#xA;Content Notes Target personas: New IAM Developers,Developers new to Okta&#xA;Changes to be made: For best effect, it makes sense to rework these articles to match “Plan your web application build” - i.e., to have a How-To \ Guide Hub style article that runs through the entire process of building a lifecycle-aware app. “Prepare your SCIM API service” Article has two distinct sections: “Preparation”, and “Test it works as a private App” “Connect Your SCIM API service to Okta” covers creating a SCIM app integration in the Admin Console “Test Your Okta SCIM integration” covers another set of tests for your app once it is set up as an Okta integration and links to another set of tests to run before submission process is complete Links to original docs: + https://developer.</description>
