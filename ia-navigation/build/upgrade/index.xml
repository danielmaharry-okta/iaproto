Content type: How-to: developer focused
A How-to document illustrates how to perform a specific task that does not rely on writing code. How-tos tend to walk the reader step by step through administrative tasks but not exclusively. They might include code snippets such as API requests and responses, or outline how to develop the required solution but without walking through the majority of the code required to implement it.</description>
