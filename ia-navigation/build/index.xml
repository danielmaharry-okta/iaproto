Content Notes Target personas: WIC App Developer,Experienced IAM developer
Changes to be made: Changes have been made to this section but they are minimized for now because:
Lack of user research on specifically how customers are working with the current upgrade docs The docs are already isolated into one section on the site and seem fairly organized, although, they would need to be analyzed from a user journey perspective in the future An educated guess would be that Upgrade docs are not used as much by customers when compared to other docs such as Authentication (We need to confirm this) Links to original docs: If a dynamic index can be customized, add a link to a doc to this ID: 310</description>
